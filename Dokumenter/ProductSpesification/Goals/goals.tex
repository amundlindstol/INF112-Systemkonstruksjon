We are going to make a multiplayer chess-application where the user has the opportunity to play both against another chess player or to play against the computer. If the user chooses to play against the computer, he can choose the skill level of the computer. There are at least three different levels; beginner, intermediate or advanced.
\newline \newline
The chess-application has an overview over the results of each game played. This is used to make a ranking scoreboard, based on the rating they get after each game.
