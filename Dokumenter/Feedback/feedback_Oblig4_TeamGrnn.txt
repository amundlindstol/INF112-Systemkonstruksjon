Feedback INF112 spring 2018 - Oblig.4

Group: Grnn

Overall feedback

Updated requested items from feedback in oblig 3
- Good, but your game is still missing a specified license as far as I can tell. (pick one during the next assignment - example MIT)

Minutes
- Good

Design model
- Have you not needed to make any major changes to the diagram except adding an interface?

Sequence diagrams
- Missing SQ diagrams for storing winner stats in DB and for a multiplayer game (Add them during the next assignment)

Source code
- You need to specify the license of your game as mentioned earlier.
- The quality of the code seems good (Readability, javadoc etc.) 
- The games AI does not work as intended - the AI is doing all sorts of crazy stuff (Like making a legal move and then teleporting accross the board to take a piece) 
- It does not look like the statistics when a player wins against another player is updated (it is still 1200) 

Presentation slides are missing from the repository

Retrospective: Good

Score: 76 (of 100)
