Overall feedback

Updated requested items from feedback in oblig 4
- Thank you! Great :)

Minutes
- Good

Design model
- Up to date

Sequence diagrams
- Good additions

Source code
- Game has the specified functionality and works well
- Quality of source code looks decent and maintainable
- Could probably have included/written more tests

Product manual
- Could have been better (guide for creating an online game, Screenshots of a game etc.)

Retrospective
- Pretty good but could probably have been a bit longer and more detailed. 
You will most likely be asked to write a retrospective on the exam so I recommend that you all think more about what went well, what went bad and how you could fix the problems during your exam prep.
 
Retrospective: Good

Overall you have done a great job this iteration. 
We hope you enjoyed the assignment, had fun and got valuable experience.
